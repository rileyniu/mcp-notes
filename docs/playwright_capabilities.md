## üéØ Tips for Effective Usage

### 1. Selector Strategy
```bash
# Good selectors (reliable)
"button[data-testid='submit-btn']"
"#main-navigation"
".product-price"

# Avoid (fragile)
"div > div > span:nth-child(3)"
```

### 2. Wait for Elements
```bash
# Always wait for dynamic content
"Wait for the search results to load, then extract the data"
```

### 3. Error Handling
```bash
# Include fallback instructions
"If the login button isn't found, look for 'Sign In' or 'Log In' text"
```

### 4. Batch Operations
```bash
# Process multiple items efficiently
"For each product in the list, extract name and price in one operation"
```

### 5. Screenshot Documentation
```bash
# Use screenshots for verification
"Take a screenshot after each major step to confirm success"
```
